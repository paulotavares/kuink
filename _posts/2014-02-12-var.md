Defines a variable in neon.
Variables must have a name and can be literals or arrays.

### Literals
To assign a value to a variable to:


```xml
<Var name="[name]">[value]</Var>
```



To read a variable:

```xml
<Var name="[name]"/>
```


### Arrays
An array is a variable with keys.
To set a value to an array

```xml
<Var name="[name]" key="[array_key]">[value]</Var>
```


To read a value from an array:

```xml
<Var name="[name]" key="[array_key]"/>
```

### Variable scope
We have 3 scopes for variables

+   Local: Default variable scope. Local variable in the code
+   Session: Available while user have an active session
+   Process: Available while user is in current process.


### Common

We can unset a variable


```xml
<Var name="[name]" clear="true"/>
```



And can dump the variable


```xml
<Var name="[name]" dump="true"/>
```



To increment a value to the variable


```xml
<Var name="[name]" sum="[value_to_increment]">[variable_value_numeric]</Var>
```
