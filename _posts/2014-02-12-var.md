Defines a variable in neon.
Variables must have a name and can be literals or arrays.

## Literals
To assign a value to a variable to:


``<Var name="[name]">[value]</Var>``



To read a variable:

``<Var name="[name]"/>``


## Arrays
An array is a variable with keys.
To set a value to an array element:

``<Var name="[name]" key="[array_key]">[value]</Var>``


To read a value from an array:

``<Var name="[name]" key="[array_key]"/>``

## Variable scope
We have 3 scopes for variables
* Local: Default variable scope. Local variable in the code
* Session: Available while user have an active session
* Process: Available while user is in current process.


## Common

We can unset a variable
``<Var name="[name]" clear="true"/>``

And can dump the variable
``<Var name="[name]" dump="true"/>``
